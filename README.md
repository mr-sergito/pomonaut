# Pomonaut

**Pomonaut** is a minimalist, privacy-first and offline-capable Pomodoro timer.

You may track your focus sessions across multiple projects, work completely offline, sync stats peer-to-peer (e.g. via Syncthing), or optionally create an account to sync with the cloud.

---

## Features

- **Project-based tracking** – assign Pomodoro sessions to different projects
- **Minimal and distraction-free** interface
- **Offline-first** – works without any account or internet connection
- **Stats dashboard** – optional, configurable and fully local
- **Self-hostable** – store your stats locally or sync via Syncthing
- **Optional cloud sync** – coming soon for non-technical users
- **Multi-platform** – runs on web, desktop (Tauri), and mobile (Capacitor)
- **Zero tracking**, no telemetry, no hidden dependencies
